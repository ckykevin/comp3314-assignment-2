# comp3314-assignment-2

Standard Implementation: 2.pth
Changing to ExponentialLR: 1.pth
Changing gamma: 3.pth
Changing stepsize: 4.pth
Changing learning rate: 5.pth
Code: template.py
In order to train different models: 
for exponentialLR, in line 182, change it to "lr_shceduler.ExponentialLR(optimizer_ft,gamma=0.1)"
for change in gamma and stepsize, in line 182, change the corresponding parameters
for change in learning rate, in line 180, change the corresponding parameters
